      <h3 id="primary-focus">Project Focus:</h3>
      <p>
        The primary focus of the project should be on analyzing household

        bills through efficient practices and renewable energy sources.
      </p>
      <h3 id="target-variable-name">Target Variable Name:</h3>
      <p>
        A suitable target variable name for the model could be
        <code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">Energy Cost Reduction Score</code>. This score would be a
        representation of the potential energy cost savings achievable through
        following the recommended advice provided by the system.
      </p>
      <h3 id="importance-of-target-variable">
        Importance of Target Variable:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The <code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">Energy Cost Reduction Score</code> is crucial for this
        project as it encapsulates the ultimate goal of helping households in
        Peru reduce their energy costs. By quantifying the potential savings
        into a single score, users can easily understand and compare the
        effectiveness of different recommendations.
      </p>
      <h3 id="example-values">Example Values:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If a household receives an
          <code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">Energy Cost Reduction Score</code> of 80%, it indicates
          that
          the recommended actions have the potential to reduce their energy
          costs by 80%.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, a score of 20% would suggest there is limited room
          for improvement in energy cost reduction through the current
          recommendations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="user-decision-making">User Decision-making:</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the <code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">Energy Cost Reduction Score</code>, users can
        prioritize which recommendations to implement. For example, a
        household with a low score may focus on adopting more energy-efficient
        appliances, while a high-scoring household may consider investing in
        solar panels for significant cost savings in the long term. This score
        serves as a practical metric for users to take actionable steps
        towards reducing their energy bills effectively.

        Negative Impact: Feeling Helpless in Balancing Environmental Concerns

      </h3>
      <p>
        In the bustling city of Lima, Sofia Garcia, an environmentally
        conscious homeowner, faces a specific challenge. Despite her
        dedication to sustainable living, Sofia finds herself struggling to
        reduce her energy costs while minimizing her carbon footprint. The
        more she tries to cut down on her electricity usage, the higher her
        bills become, leading to a significant pain point in her life — the
        intersection of environmental values and financial stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the solution: a project leveraging machine learning to address
        Sofia&#39;s challenge, focusing on a key target variable named
        &#39;Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score.&#39; This variable
        holds the potential to transform Sofia&#39;s situation by offering
        personalized energy efficiency improvement recommendations, designed
        to guide her towards greener practices and cost savings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, Sofia decides to test this solution. As she engages with the
        system, she&#39;s presented with a &#39;Carbon Footprint Reduction
        Potential Score&#39; of 85%, indicating a high level of potential for
        reducing her carbon footprint through specific actions. The system
        suggests installing energy-efficient appliances and adjusting her
        energy usage during peak hours to mitigate her pain point of high
        energy bills and environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially surprised by the high score and recommendations, Sofia
        contemplates the suggested actions. After careful consideration, she
        decides to follow the system&#39;s advice and invests in
        energy-efficient appliances and adjusts her energy usage patterns
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, Sofia experiences positive impacts such as a noticeable
        drop in her monthly energy bills, a reduction in her household&#39;s
        carbon footprint, and a sense of accomplishment in aligning her
        actions with her environmental values. The insights derived from the
        &#39;Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score&#39; not only
        empowered Sofia to make informed decisions but also improved her
        quality of life by effectively managing her energy costs and
        environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on the broader implications of this project, the
        transformative power of machine learning is evident. By providing
        actionable insights and personalized recommendations, individuals like
        Sofia facing similar challenges can leverage data-driven decisions to
        achieve a balance between sustainability and financial well-being in
        the domain of household energy management. This innovative use of
        machine learning showcases its potential to drive real-world solutions
        and empower individuals to make impactful changes in their lives and
        the environment.
