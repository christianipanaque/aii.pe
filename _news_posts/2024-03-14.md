### Top AIs still fail IQ tests (7 minute read)

Recent tests reveal that advanced AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Google's "Gemini Advanced" struggle with visual IQ tests, scoring below thresholds for measurable IQ. While ChatGPT-4 shows marginal pattern recognition skills, it makes visual misidentifications and logical errors, suggesting a significant gap compared to human intelligence. These findings imply that we might still be some distance away from achieving generally intelligent AI systems.

### The Future of Poetry (14 minute read)

38 AI experts and 39 English experts were asked to rate and guess whether poems were written by an AI or a human. The human came in 1st place, while Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude came in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places respectively, both in writing quality and their ability to fool respondents into believing their poems were authored by a human. English experts were far better at discerning which poems were written by AI, which points to a need for them to play a greater role in helping shape future versions of AI technology.
